# Hi there :wave:

Hello I'm Angel, a software developer with especial interest in embedded devices by day and a sleepy creature by night.

I love low-level programming of devices, messing with registers, expending hours trying to understand what's actually saying the datasheet. And later loathe myself for hours because how could I could not seen that before, right, right???

I'm always trying and learning new things, my current brief wishlist of things to learn:

* Linux Kernel development. I even reunited the courage to submit a few contributions in the IIO subsystem!
* Rust Programming Language. I like system programming, and Rust seems the way to go
* Languages, lots of languages. Currently studying Japanese こんにちは, エンジェルです.
* Analog photography (moonshot, I'm scared of all those pesky chemicals involved in the process)

On weekends you can find me hiking on the mountains blasting post-punk and city-pop playlists carrying my trusty Canon EOS-1200D or messing around with some embedded board.
